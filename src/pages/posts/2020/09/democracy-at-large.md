Are you afraid to call this president a fascist or authoritarian because of
being ostracized from your community? Maybe you'll be labeled un-American. You
are not alone. Here's an
[urgent wake up call](https://eand.co/we-dont-know-how-to-warn-you-any-harder-america-is-dying-26ff80912391)
from a journalist whose parents fled fascism seeking a better life in America.
They know the signs of a failing democracy better than us tired Netflix
watchers.

We must call this failing out or risk loosing our democracy entirely. I see this
failure across the party lines in the void of our collective political will.
Instead of hope, corporate media had filled this vacancy with fear and as we
might know from _Dune_, "fear is the mind killer".

I realize the Republican party continues to call out the left as authoritarian
and a threat to freedom. They are the masters of political projection. They seem
to always be one spin step ahead, and are willing to use this language against
their opponents before their opponents have a chance to call them out. This is
nothing new, and they're better at this political game than most. I often wonder
why the Democrat party seems so ill-equipped. It's almost as if they don't want
to win.

Enough with the party bashing. This isn't about left versus right, good cop/bad
cop, donkeys, or elephants. It's a matter of defending our right to be free,
know peace, and have voice to our grievances. To live in fear of being
disappeared, tortured, or murdered is currently the fate of too many peoples. If
you can't conceive of this happening in America, then you're probably in the
privileged class of citizenship which has been a sliding scale for people of
color since our country's inception.

On this labor day, as we celebrate the difficult and persecuted solidarity
movements of labor who fought and died for a forty-hour work week, the right to
strike, and an end to child labor remember they too were not embraced by the two
party system. They were certainly labeled un-American for their courageous
resistance putting their tired bodies on the line for what they knew was right.
I'm praying we can continue the fight to push our country towards democracy for
all and away from privilege for the few.
