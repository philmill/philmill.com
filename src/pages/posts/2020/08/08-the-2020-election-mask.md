### A Context in Brief

There's lots of talk around the 2020 presidential election coming up. When I say
talk, specifically I'm seeing pleas for Biden and questions around how his
running mate will fair. I see the dread of our collective futures with another
four years run by POTUS 45 and rightly so. The media fires shots at the other
side never to point the gun at their own political failings. There's also some
debate whether to withhold leftist votes altogether and let the Democrats fail
yet again. As for the right, I do hear a tiny voice of reason which wants
conservatism, but not the kind currently in office.

As a radical, I have little faith in electoral politics. A vote for either of
these disgraceful hollow talking heads is a vote for more of the same endless
wars. Is one worse than the other, I really believe it depends on which side of
the gun you are on and how many family members you've lost to American
imperialism. It depends on your class status in the states. While canvasing for
Bernie I met people who had never voted, ever for any reason. To them policy
doesn't affect their lives. They are the forgotten.

### Votes and Actions

Will I vote for Biden, absolutely **yes**. But that's the least anyone can do
in 2020. We cannot afford to put aside criticism for the laughable democracy
we've inherited and let rot. We cannot forget the Democratic party has not been
the party of the people for generations now. I don't blame anyone for not voting
big D in 2020. By continuing to vote for the "lesser of two evils" we remove all
political leverage we have as voters against this plutocracy. I do vow to put my
body in the streets until we have equity in justice and health care is a
universal right. I can only hope that the majority of Biden supporters will do
the same.

### Conclusion

There is no going back now. The lie that is American innocence and
exceptionalism has been exposed so blatantly by this Neo-liberal symptom we call
Trump coupled with a pandemic, and the beginnings of run away climate change
have set in motion a drastic turning of the tide. This can be for the betterment
of all or a long dark night. It's up to us through direct action and mutual aid
to make change to suit our needs.
