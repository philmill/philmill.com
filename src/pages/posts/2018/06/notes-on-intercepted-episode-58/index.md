Some background on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) before we
dive into NY congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's view of it as a
backdrop to my sentiment of established democratic representatives.

In 2018, ICE requested 7.9 billion dollars for their annual budget employing
20,967 full time equivalents and received **7.6 billion** with the support of
established democrats. [^1] To put that in perspective, the FBI which is the
largest investigative organization requested 8.8 billion employing 31,999 FTEs.
[^2] ICE is under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security which
isn't in the jurisdiction of the older historic Department of Justice. It's
mission is "empowered to handle all criminal prosecutions and civil suits in
which the United States had an interest." [^3] Why doesnt immigrant prosecutions
fall into that mission statement? It would seem the entire DHS premise is to be
outside the oversight of the Attorney General. From my limited research it
appears self regulatory [^4].

There seem to be three bipartisan issues congress across the board support, all
things pro-Israel, funding the military industrial complex which includes mass
surveillance of it's citizens, and the prison industrial complex which includes
ICE. I extend her quote about immigration to all three of these issues. It's
past time these long standing corporate funded candidates are voted out.

It's incredibility important these types of nominees are promoted for their
courage to run under "democratic socialists" and bringing that term to light
under a government which works hard to suppress any anti-capitalist efforts. Not
to suggest Ocasio-Cortez is outright anti-capitalist, but she has some radical
ideas which are certainly in the socialist realm. I intend to write more about
this subject as we get closer to November and beyond.

Let us note that Ocasio-Cortez isn't promoting the abolishment of all our
immigration policies,
